DataChest
=
DataChest application makes you easily encrypt sensitive files. Oh! it's also support decrypt the encrypted one.

Background
=
I started this project few months ago and this type of application is on all over the world.
Yes, I know this project is not unique and not rare, but there's reason. I wanted to make my own project and manage the project via version control system like GitHub. That's why I started and push this project on GitHub :D.
